I have been doing MUNs since 2007 and since 8 years I have found myself most comfortable handling these two councils. The agenda in these two committees  reflect an urgency and a direness in their problems which provide for application of mind and brings out the best in the delegates and the executive board. Hence, these two committees are my preferred ones. Reason for preferring to be chair is because of my familiarity with procedures and experience in handling delegates since nearly a decade now. The diversity in the delegates, in terms of experience is what I can handle really well.  I hope you consider my  candidature for these positions in the two councils.');
